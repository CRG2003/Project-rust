Project Rust is a farming rogue-like being developed between two final year computing students as a personal project.

The project is still under development, but we intend to experiment with game mechanics and end up with a game where you have a farm base and explore various dungeons.
While there isn't as hard of a reset as other rogue-likes, we want to try and still implemetn some farm of challenge with farming gameplay.
